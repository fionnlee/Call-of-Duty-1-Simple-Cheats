# CoD Rapid Fire

`Note : Press the left mouse button for fast fire. However, when the server uses anti-fast fire, it detects and automatically punishes.`

# CoD Trigger Bot with Key

`Note : Actually, I didn't find a good value for the trigger bot; sometimes it gets bugged. When weapons change, etc., hold the CTRL key to enable the hack and aim at the enemy skin.`
<br>
`Bugs : while weapons change and teammate skins also trigger. Find your own management trick if you use this hack.`

# CoD Trigger Bot without Key

`Note : trigger bot without key means there is no need to press and button to enbale it. bugs weren't fixed.`
